## OpenCVTrackers

> OpenCV 4 comes with a tracking API that contains implementations of many single object tracking algorithms. There are 8 different trackers available in OpenCV 4.2 â€” BOOSTING, MIL, KCF, TLD, MEDIANFLOW, GOTURN, MOSSE, and CSRT.

See this [learnopencv](https://learnopencv.com/object-tracking-using-opencv-cpp-python/) article to learn more about the different trackers and their use.

Here we want to test those 1-object trackers on multiple videos and multiple targets so that we can identify the one we will choose to perform real time multiple object tracking under our situations.

To run those tests, place your `inputVideos` folder in your current folder (or somewhere else and then change all `./inputVideos/` by the right path). In the `inputVideos` folder there must be your videos under a `{videos_type}` subfolder. For instance, mines are placed in `./inputVideos/bateau/` or `./inputVideos/velo/`.

For the results folder, create the `./RealTimeMOT/OpenCVTrackers/outputVideos/` folder, with one subfolder per type of video.

### 1 Tracker 1 Video 1 Target Test

To test one tracker on one target on one video, use `test.py` : select the tracker within the list `tracker_types`, the input folder `"./inputVideos/{videos_type}/"` and the video name and extension. 

Run the file, select the target on the first frame and then press Enter, the output video will be in your `outputVideos` folder.

### Initialization of the targets

Before testing all the trackers on all your videos, you have to specify the targets. For this use `initialize.py` : select the input folder `"./inputVideos/`, the subfolder corresponding to the type of the videos you want to initialize `"{videos_type}"` and run the file. 

You will select, on the first frame of each video, each target you want to track. Select the box of one target, press Enter, then you can select the next target. After you have selected the last target, double press Enter and you will continue with the next video. If you select a target that is too small or outpasses the limits of the frame, the target will not count and you'll pass to the next video. 

The results will be stored in the `"./RealTimeMOT/OpenCVTrackers/dataFiles/init/{videos_type}/"` folder.

### Test each tracker on each target of each video

After you have initialized all the targets for all videos of each video type, use `testAll.py` : fill `video_types` with the list of your video types, select the input folder `"./inputVideos/`, the folder with the initializations of your targets `"./RealTimeMOT/OpenCVTracvkers/dataFiles/init/"`, the output folder for the video results `"./RealTimeMOT/OpenCVTrackers/outputVideos/"` and the output folder for the data results `"./RealTimeMOT/OpenCVTracvkers/dataFiles/test/"`.

## YoloV8

> YOLOv8 is the latest version of the acclaimed real-time object detection and image segmentation model. YOLOv8 is built on cutting-edge advancements in deep learning and computer vision, offering unparalleled performance in terms of speed and accuracy.  
[See more](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)  

We use YOLOv8 as a multiple object detector, in order to rapidly identify the objects present in each frame. YOLOv8 is able to detect the objects (the objects on wich he was trained for) in a whole image without having to compute several times some parts of the image.

The file `yolov8_app.py` allows to download the latest pretrained model of YOLOv8 (`yolov8n.pt`) and apply it to each frame of the video specified `"./inputVideos/bateau/bateau_1.mp4"`. On each frame, the detections computed by the model are filtered in order to keep the ones representing one of the `OBJECTS_OF_INTEREST` listed that have a confidence score higher than `100*CONF_TRESHOLD`. 

The data for those detections is stored in `"./RealTimeMOT/YoloV8/bateau_3_0.1/det/det.txt"` in the [MOT format](https://motchallenge.net/instructions/) (1 detection per line) :  

    {frame_number},-1,{location.left},{location.top},{width},{height},{score},-1,-1

Moreover, to keep the MOT format, we store in a `{video_file_name}` folder a file `seqinfo.ini` that follows these directives :

    [Sequence]
    name={video_file_name}
    imDir=img1
    frameRate={fps}
    seqLength={frame_count}
    imWidth={frame_width}
    imHeight={frame_height}
    imExt=.jpg

In a subfolder `{video_file_name}/det` will be stored the `det.txt` file containing the data for the filtered detections, and in an other subfolder `{video_file_name}/img1` will be stored each frame of the video, in `.jpg` format.
